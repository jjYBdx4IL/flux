Introduction
------------
Flux Chess is an attempt to write a computer chess engine entirely in 
Java. The speed of most Java Virtual Machines is improving nowadays. 
However compared to other C/C++ chess engines Flux is still slow (or 
maybe my algorithms are not that sophisticated?). 

As a pure UCI chess engine, Flux does not have a graphical user 
interface. You can load him however into your favorite chess program if 
it supports the UCI protocol. 


Features
--------
Below you will find a small list of what I have already implemented in 
Flux. Nothing special though as many computer chess engines have those 
features as well. 

In addition Flux supports multi pv output, which means Flux can show 
multiple best pv lines.
